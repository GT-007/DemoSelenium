1) Which domain you are having good hands on?
I have strong experience in the automation testing domain, particularly in web and API testing. I've worked Manufacturing domains like Airbus and ST Microelectronics.And mostlly worked on Automation tool such as UFT ,Rumba,Selenium(TestNG,POM).



2) Do you write SQL Queries or Stored procedures or you have different team who get involved on it?
Yes, I do write SQL queries to validate data and perform backend testing. While stored procedures are usually written by the development team, I do review and sometimes assist in debugging or understanding them for testing purposes.



3) How do you do your testing of the code you have written?
I follow a structured approach using unit testing frameworks (like JUnit/TestNG for Java), and perform integration and regression testing. I automate test scripts using tools like Selenium, Cypress, or RestAssured, and integrate them with CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.

4) Which Code repository you have used?
I have experience using Git repositories, primarily via GitHub, GitLab.



5) Which MODEL did you follow while working on projects? [Waterfall, Agile]
Mostly I worked waterfall Model , but now We are using Agile recent projects.

6) Any idea on SPRINT?
Yes, a Sprint is a time-boxed period (typically 2-4 weeks) in Agile where a specific set of tasks or user stories are developed and tested. It allows for iterative development and quick feedback loops.



7) Which front end technology you have knowledge or worked upon? [This question is for JAVA, .Net, PHP, Node]
From a testing perspective, Iâ€™ve worked with applications built using Java frameworks like React and Angular, as well as .NET-based front ends. I understand how these technologies work, which helps in creating robust test .



8) What is the primary advantage of integrating AI with automation tools in software testing?
AI enhances test automation by enabling smart test case generation, self-healing tests, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, which improves efficiency and reduces maintenance efforts.



9) How does the Agile methodology impact the role of an Automation QA Resource?
In Agile, QA is involved from the beginning. As an Automation QA, I collaborate closely with developers, write tests in parallel with development, ensure rapid feedback, and continuously update automation suites to keep up with fast-paced releases.



10) What is the importance of having a strong understanding of both SDLC and STLC in automation testing?
Understanding SDLC helps in aligning testing efforts with development phases, while STLC provides a clear roadmap for planning, designing, executing, and maintaining test cases. Together, they ensure efficient and effective automation strategies throughout the project lifecycle.



11) Describe how proficiency in API testing tools like Postman or SoapUI complements automation testing efforts.
API testing is crucial for validating backend logic independently of UI. Tools like Postman and SoapUI help test endpoints quickly, automate tests, and validate responses. This complements UI automation by ensuring that all layers of the appli
